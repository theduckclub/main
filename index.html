	<h2> Why Ducks are the Best </h2>

		<p> If you haven't taken the time to consider the duck, you've missed out on a key facet of the human experience. For starters, ducks can both swim, fly, and walk. For all the feats of human engineering, no one machine humans have built can accomplish all three. Furthermore, baby ducks are adorable, especailly as they trail behind their mother, all orderly in a single file line. Another point, ducks are also people's friends. They've brought us the classic fairy tale "The Ugly Duckling" and are even used as a natural solution to handling plant eating pests like locusts. Last but certaintly not least, the way ducks eat peas out of a bowl is beyond satisfying and something you won't regret checking out. </p>

	<h2> Club Info </h2>

		<p> Duck Club is a place to appreciate the majestic waterfowl that is the duck. We meet every Tuesday at 4PM at 1234 Duck Pond where we discuss all the reasons we love ducks
			while feeding bread to those ducks at the pond. All are welcome! Stop on by, bring some bread, and prepare yourself for a good time!
